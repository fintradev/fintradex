# FintradeX Runtime

ℹ️ The runtime (in other words, a state transition function), refers to the core logic of the FintradeX parachain that is
responsible for validating blocks and executing the state changes they define.

💁 The runtime in this project is constructed using ready-made FRAME pallets that ship with
[Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk), and custom pallets designed for FintradeX's financial trading functionality.

- **On-Chain Verification**: All proofs are verified on-chain to confirm finalized (irreversible) state of counterparty chains
- **Coprocessor Model**: Off-chain verification operations with cryptographic proofs of correct execution reported back on-chain

### ⚡ Proof Aggregation
- **Scalable Trust-Free Interoperability**: Hyperbridge verifies and aggregates finalized states of all chains into a single proof
- **Universal Cross-Chain Messages**: Any blockchain can receive all cross-chain messages aggregated by Hyperbridge
- **Efficient Verification**: Eliminates the need for individual chain verification, reducing computational overhead

### 🚀 Permissionless Relayers
- **Decentralized Network**: First cross-chain protocol leveraging cryptographic proofs for permissionless relayers
- **No Whitelisting Required**: Relayers operate without whitelisting or staking requirements
- **Fee-Based Incentives**: Fully incentivized by user fees for cross-chain operations

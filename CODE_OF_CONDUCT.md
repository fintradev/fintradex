# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion,
or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive,
and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### FintraDex Community Guidelines

As a decentralized finance platform built on Polkadot, we are committed to:

* **Technical Excellence**: Maintaining high standards for code quality, security, and performance
* **Transparency**: Open and honest communication about development progress, roadmaps, and challenges
* **Inclusivity**: Welcoming contributors of all skill levels and backgrounds
* **Decentralization**: Respecting the community-driven nature of blockchain governance
* **Constructive Discussion**: Keeping technical forums focused on development, architecture, and improvement proposals rather than speculation or price discussion

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are
expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable
behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits,
code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to
ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is
representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include
using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as
an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further
defined and clarified by project maintainers.

**Community Scope (FintraDex spaces)**
- GitHub repositories and discussions under the `fintradev` organization
- Issue trackers and pull requests
- Official chat and social channels: Telegram (**https://t.me/fintradex**) and X/Twitter (**https://x.com/FintraDex**)
- Online events, AMAs, and forums managed by the project

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting
the project team at **team@fintradex.io**. The project team will review and investigate all complaints,
and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of
specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary
or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

### Enforcement Guidelines

We use these Community Impact Guidelines to determine consequences:

1. **Correction**
   - *Community Impact*: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.
   - *Consequence*: A private, written warning and education around expected behavior.

2. **Warning**
   - *Community Impact*: A single incident or series of actions that violate the Code of Conduct.
   - *Consequence*: A warning with consequences for continued behavior, up to temporary restrictions.

3. **Temporary Ban**
   - *Community Impact*: A serious violation or repeated inappropriate behavior.
   - *Consequence*: Temporary ban from community spaces and interactions for a specified period.

4. **Permanent Ban**
   - *Community Impact*: Demonstrating a pattern of violation, harassment, or aggression; or posing a safety risk.
   - *Consequence*: Permanent removal from all community spaces and contribution rights.

### No Retaliation & Privacy

We will not tolerate retaliation against anyone who reports an issue in good faith. We keep reporter identities confidential to the extent legally possible and share only with those who need to know to investigate and resolve the matter.

### Conflicts of Interest

If a report involves a maintainer or core team member, it will be handled by another maintainer without a conflict, or by an external reviewer appointed by the project leads.

### Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was made in error, you may appeal by replying to the decision email with additional context. Appeals are reviewed by maintainers not involved in the original decision.

### DeFi-Specific Guidelines

To keep discussions productive and compliant:
- No market manipulation, coordinated “pump & dump,” or misleading price claims.
- Keep trading talk minimal; prioritize technical development, architecture, testing, audits, and governance.
- Do not share private keys, seed phrases, or sensitive operational details.

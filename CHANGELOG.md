## Maintenance notes (for maintainers)
- When cutting a release:
  1. Update the relevant section above with changes since last tag.
  2. Create a tag (e.g., `v0.1.1`) and a GitHub Release with artifacts (runtime `.wasm`, chain spec JSON).
  3. Move items from **Unreleased** into the new version block with the release date.
- Keep roadmap/milestones in `README.md` or GitHub Projects â€” do not place future plans here.
